"2008-09-25 15:27:07";"<p>I have a webapp that I am in the middle of doing some load/performance testing on, particularily on a feature where we expect a few hundred users to be accessing the same page and hitting refresh about every 10 seconds on this page. One area of improvement that we found we could make with this function was to cache the responses from the web service for some period of time, since the data is not changing.</p><p>After implementing this basic caching, in some further testing I found out that I didn't consider how concurrent threads could access the Cache at the same time. I found that within the matter of ~100ms, about 50 threads were trying to fetch the object from the Cache, finding that it had expired, hitting the web service to fetch the data, and then putting the object back in the cache.</p><p>The original code looked something like this:</p><pre><code>private SomeData[] getSomeDataByEmail(WebServiceInterface service, String email) {  final String key = 'Data-' + email;  SomeData[] data = (SomeData[]) StaticCache.get(key);  if (data == null) {      data = service.getSomeDataForEmail(email);      StaticCache.set(key, data, CACHE_TIME);  }  else {      logger.debug('getSomeDataForEmail: using cached object');  }  return data;}</code></pre><p>So, to make sure that only one thread was calling the web service when the object at <code>key</code> expired, I thought I needed to synchronize the Cache get/set operation, and it seemed like using the cache key would be a good candidate for an object to synchronize on (this way, calls to this method for email b@b.com would not be blocked by method calls to a@a.com).</p><p>I updated the method to look like this:</p><pre><code>private SomeData[] getSomeDataByEmail(WebServiceInterface service, String email) {  SomeData[] data = null;  final String key = 'Data-' + email;  synchronized(key) {          data =(SomeData[]) StaticCache.get(key);    if (data == null) {        data = service.getSomeDataForEmail(email);        StaticCache.set(key, data, CACHE_TIME);    }    else {      logger.debug('getSomeDataForEmail: using cached object');    }  }  return data;}</code></pre><p>I also added logging lines for things like 'before synchronization block', 'inside synchronization block', 'about to leave synchronization block', and 'after synchronization block', so I could determine if I was effectively synchronizing the get/set operation.</p><p>However it doesn't seem like this has worked. My test logs have output like:</p><blockquote>  <p>(log output is 'threadname' 'logger name' 'message')<br>  http-80-Processor253 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: about to enter synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor253 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: inside synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor253 cache.StaticCache - get: object at key [SomeData-test@test.com] has expired<br>  http-80-Processor253 cache.StaticCache - get: key [SomeData-test@test.com] returning value [null]<br>  http-80-Processor263 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: about to enter synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor263 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: inside synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor263 cache.StaticCache - get: object at key [SomeData-test@test.com] has expired<br>  http-80-Processor263 cache.StaticCache - get: key [SomeData-test@test.com] returning value [null]<br>  http-80-Processor131 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: about to enter synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor131 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: inside synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor131 cache.StaticCache - get: object at key [SomeData-test@test.com] has expired<br>  http-80-Processor131 cache.StaticCache - get: key [SomeData-test@test.com] returning value [null]<br>  http-80-Processor104 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: inside synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor104 cache.StaticCache - get: object at key [SomeData-test@test.com] has expired<br>  http-80-Processor104 cache.StaticCache - get: key [SomeData-test@test.com] returning value [null]<br>  http-80-Processor252 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: about to enter synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor283 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: about to enter synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor2 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: about to enter synchronization block<br>  http-80-Processor2 jsp.view-page - getSomeDataForEmail: inside synchronization block  </p></blockquote><p>I wanted to see only one thread at a time entering/exiting the synchronization block around the get/set operations.</p><p>Is there an issue in synchronizing on String objects? I thought the cache-key would be a good choice as it is unique to the operation, and even though the <code>final String key</code> is declared within the method, I was thinking that each thread would be getting a reference to <em>the same object</em> and therefore would synchronization on this single object.</p><p>What am I doing wrong here?</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: after looking further at the logs, it seems like methods with the same synchronization logic where the key is always the same, such as </p><pre><code>final String key = 'blah';...synchronized(key) { ...</code></pre><p>do not exhibit the same concurrency problem - only one thread at a time is entering the block.</p><p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Thanks to everyone for the help! I accepted the first answer about <code>intern()</code>ing Strings, which solved my initial problem - where multiple threads were entering synchronized blocks where I thought they shouldn't, because the <code>key</code>'s had the same value.</p><p>As others have pointed out, using <code>intern()</code> for such a purpose and synchronizing on those Strings does indeed turn out to be a bad idea - when running JMeter tests against the webapp to simulate the expected load, I saw the used heap size grow to almost 1GB in just under 20 minutes.</p><p>Currently I'm using the simple solution of just synchronizing the entire method - but I <strong>really</strong> like the code samples provided by martinprobst and MBCook, but since I have about 7 similar <code>getData()</code> methods in this class currently (since it needs about 7 different pieces of data from a web service), I didn't want to add almost-duplicate logic about getting and releasing locks to each method. But this is definitely very, very valuable info for future usage. I think these are ultimately the correct answers on how best to make an operation like this thread-safe, and I'd give out more votes to these answers if I could!</p>";"Problem with synchronizing on String objects?";"<java><multithreading><synchronization>";"S"

(ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)    The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.</p><pre><code>For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4},A solution set is:(-1, 0, 1)(-1, -1, 2)</code></pre><p>I went through the site and found this suggested solution:</p><pre><code>public ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; threeSum(int[] num) {    Arrays.sort(num);    HashSet&lt;ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; lstSoln = new HashSet&lt;ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;();    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; tempArr = null;    for (int i = 0; i &lt; num.length; i++) {        int j = i + 1;        int k = num.length - 1;        while (j &lt; k) {            int sum3 = num[i] + num[j] + num[k];            if (sum3 &lt; 0) {                j++;            } else if (sum3 &gt; 0) {                k--;            } else {                tempArr = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();                Collections.addAll(tempArr, num[i], num[j], num[k]);                lstSoln.add(tempArr);                j++;                k--;            }        }    }    return new ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;(lstSoln);}</code></pre><p>As you can see, this takes every number and then follows with two number after the current index. So, it is pretty clear that once the first positive number is reached, we are just doing useless looping and we are not going to find any triplet adding to 0. So I modified the solution and added a condition after <code>for</code></p><pre><code>if (num[i] &gt; 0)    break;</code></pre><p>Effectively this should lower the number of times the for loop runs and hence reduce the time taken to find the solution. This I even checked by adding a counter and incrementing it at every <code>if()</code>. Every time the <code>COUNTER</code> for my solution is less than the counter for suggested solution.</p><p>But still, when I enter my modified solution at there checking page, it either causes time out error or the time taken is showed to be more than the unmodified version! I want to know what's wrong with my modification?</p>";"Difference between two similar algorithms of 3Sum?";"<java><algorithm>";"S"

I can probably best describe it as an audit trail (?) of sorts, recording what my test audience did, on what date, and on what computer. These are all manual input, so the people entered this information manually, which is then saved onto the database, and then view-able by the administrator.</p><p>Here's the SQL statement I use for retrieving the data:</p><pre><code>SELECT fld 1 as EmpNumber, fld2 as EmpName, fld6 as DateFROM tblReportTemp  LEFT JOIN tblPersonalInfo b ON $P{hrStoreOp}= b.ID_PERSONALWHERE computerName = $P{COMPNAME}ORDER BY fld6,fld2 asc</code></pre><p>My team mate decided to make all the fields a VARCHAR type, and then decided to have the users type in the date, as opposed to, using a date picker. So a lot of test users, the lazy ones, simply put in whatever it is that's easiest to reach, like Q, or 1, or even space. So first of all, it won't arrange properly by date, and second, my attempts to convert the data into a date via TO_DATE(fld6, 'MM/dd/yy') before arranging it has been met with failure, since it can't convert 'Q' to a date.</p><p>I've since replaced the textbox with a date picker, however, we are not allowed to modify the database.</p><p>So my proposed solution is to modify my SQL statement above to filter out those that can't be converted to date.

The java action class has the latest value for totalRows.</p><p>The editRows function is calling another function getResponse() when the loop has finished.

This value is not in a jqGrid.  I need to refresh the individual field and obtain the updated value.  For instance, after editRows() has completed, the value of 'totalItems' could have been doubled to 10 from 5.</p><p>Within my getResponse() function, I've tried updating this value by using the following, but it hasn't worked.</p><pre><code>document.getElementById('headerBar').reload</code></pre><p>I just need to update the values in this div without submitting a form.</p>";"Update single JSP page element without using form";"<java><jquery><jsp><struts>";"S"

"2014-02-09 00:53:34";"<p>Some background, then some questions.</p><p>I have only recently discovered that an interface (or class) may be generic in the type of (checked) exception that its methods may throw. For example:</p><pre><code>interface GenericRunnable&lt;X extends Exception&gt; {    void run() throws X;}</code></pre><p>The point is if you later instantiate this with, say, <code>IOException</code> and invoke the <code>run</code> method, the compiler knows you need to either catch <code>IOException</code> or mark it as thrown. Better still, if <code>X</code> was a <code>RuntimeException</code>, you don't need to handle it at all.</p><p>Here's a contrived example using the above interface, but it's basically a callback and should be quite common.</p><pre><code>public &lt;X extends Exception&gt; void runTwice(GenericRunnable&lt;X&gt; runnable) throws X {    runnable.run(); runnable.run();}...public myMethod() throws MyException {    runTwice(myRunnable);}</code></pre><p>We're calling a generic utility method <code>runTwice</code> (perhaps defined in an external library) to run our own specific method with a specific checked exception, and we don't lose any information about which specific checked exception might be thrown.</p><p>The alternative would have been to simply use <code>throws Exception</code> on both the <code>Runnable.run</code> method and the <code>runTwice</code> method. This would not restrict any implementation of the <code>Runnable</code> interface but the advantage of checked exceptions would be lost. Or there could have been no <code>throws</code> at all, also losing the advantage of checked exceptions and potentially forcing the implementation to wrap.</p><p>Because I had never seen <code>throws X</code>, maybe I've missed something. Furthermore, I have seen the callback example used as an argument against checked exceptions several times without it being refuted. (This question is not interested in the pros/cons of checked exceptions.)</p><p><strong>Is <code>throws X</code> generally a good idea? What are the pros and cons? Can you give some examples that either use <code>throws X</code> or didn't but should have?</strong></p><p>Basically, I would like some further insight. You might comment on the following examples.</p><ul><li><p><code>OutputStream</code> throws <code>IOException</code> (perhaps <code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code> could extends <code>GenericOutputStream&lt;RuntimeException&gt;</code>)</p></li><li><p><code>Callable</code> / <code>Future.get</code></p></li><li><p>Commons Pool <code>borrowObject</code> / <code>makeObject</code></p></li></ul><p>(Since editing, I am not asking if these could/should have been designed differently in retrospect.

"2013-09-23 05:53:24";"<p>I'm using a <code>MouseMoveListener</code> on a composite to update the image on another canvas. Basically, if the user drags Composite1 to somewhere on his screen, that will call the mouseMoveEventListener everytime the mouse moves, which will get the x,y location of the mouse, take a screenshot using <code>Awt.robot.captureScreenRegion</code>, and try to update the image of Canvas1 by calling its <code>repaint()</code> method. The purpose is just to show the user a preview of what's under the composite as he's dragging it.</p><p>Here's the problem. While the mouseMove callback is called, and it in turns takes the screenshot and calls the repaint method in time, the actual <code>paintControl()</code> listener method of the canvas (listening to its Paint event) is not being called each time the mouse moves. I.e, if you drag the composite, then pause a few seconds, that will call the repaint method. But if you just drag it all the way to the left of your screen without pausing, the repaint method will not be called with every mousemove, it will only be called when you stop / pause moving the pause.</p><p>Is there a solution, i.e can the paint event be forced to occur everytime the mouse moves? Should I start a new thread for the repainting / previewing? Both the preview shell and the main shell are two separate shells.</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Method which draws the image:</p><pre><code>canvas.addPaintListener(new PaintListener()        {            public void paintControl(PaintEvent e)            {                if (img != null)                    e.gc.drawImage(img, 0, 0);            }        });</code></pre><p>(The image is converted from BufferedImage to Image before repaint() is called. From system.out.println logs I can see that all that is happening correctly, only the logs within <code>paintControl()</code> aren't printed till I stop moving the mouse.)</p><p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Event handling code:</p><pre><code>public void mouseMove(MouseEvent e){    if (e.stateMask == 0)        return;    //Just some wrapper methods to do shell.setLocation(), shell.getBounds().x, shell.getBounds.y    setLocation(getX() + e.x, getY() + e.y);}public void controlMoved(ControlEvent e){    updatePreview();}public void updatePreview(){    //Just a wrapper around Awt.robot, uses selectionCanvas's toDisplay() to get coordinates, takes    //screenshot, converts it from BufferedImage to Image, and returns.

We would be using a single point-to-point queue.  Both sides are Java-based.  The question is whether to send the event data itself in the JMS message body or to send a pointer to the data so that the stand-alone program can retrieve it.  Details below.</p><p>I have a j2ee application that supports data entry of new and updated persons and related events.  The person records and associated events are written to an Oracle database.  There are also stand-alone, separate programs that contribute new person and event records to the database.  When a new event occurs through any of 5-10 different application functions, I need to notify remote systems through an outbound interface using an industry-specific standard messaging protocol.  The outbound interface has been designed as a stand-alone application to support scalability through asynchronous operation and by moving it to a separate server.</p><p>The j2ee application currently has most of the data in memory at the time the event is entered.  The data would consist of approximately 6 different objects; a person object and some with multiple instances for an average size in the range of 3000 to 20,000 bytes.  Some special cases could be many times this amount.</p><p>From a performance and reliability perspective, should I model the JMS message to pass all the data needed to create the interface message, or model the JMS message to contain record keys for the data and have the stand-alone Java application retrieve the data to create the interface message?</p>";"JMS message.

When dealing with 'close()' statements, it's common to need exception handling within the finally block. Ideally, we'd want to maintain both exceptions and propagate them up (as both of them may contain useful information). The only way I can think of to do this is to have a variable outside the try-catch-finally scope to save a reference to a thrown exception.

"2013-09-24 18:07:54";"<p>So I think I've found the source of my memory leak. Based on this article: <a href='http://android-developers.blogspot.ca/2009/01/avoiding-memory-leaks.html' rel='nofollow'>http://android-developers.blogspot.ca/2009/01/avoiding-memory-leaks.html</a> it's bad to have a static Bitmap drawable and set it on an ImageView. This is because, once set (imageView.setImageBitmap(bitmap)) the ImageView itself is set as a <b>Callback</b> on the Bitmap.  Hence, on rotate, the Bitmap, since it's static, remains and still contains a callback to the previous ImageView, which also has a reference to the previous activity.  Hence the previous activity is not destroyed!</p><p>I believe I have a similar issue, but it's not due to a static variable, but a Singleton ImageCache class.  Basically this ImageCache is alive while the app is running and is called using getInstance(Context context).  Each bitmap that is stored in it also gets set on an ImageView at some point.</p><p><strong>The Memory Leak:</strong> When the screen is rotated, the bitmap, which is still in memory, has a callback to the previous Image View.  Hence, the previous activity is not destroyed.  I don't, however, want to recycle and destroy this bitmap as it's probably used elsewhere in the app.  What I think I need to do is remove the specific ImageView being destroyed from the Bitmaps callback set.  How do I do this?  Or is my analysis completely wrong?  Appreciate the help!</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p><p>So it looks like the source of the problem is a ViewPager in my activity.  Basically, I have a Fragment ViewPager that I've added to the Header of my ListView.  That is, I call <code>mListView.addHeaderView(mViewPager);</code> This works fine, up until I rotate the screen.  Once I rotate the screen I notice the fragments are being leaked.  For example, I start the app with 3 fragments in the ViewPager.  When I rotate, I notice that the original 3 are re-created and an additional three are created.  This is not visible to the user though!  The previous three are being held onto in the background for some reason.  I'm able to see this by tracking the <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onCreate()</code> calls for the fragment.  Any idea why this is happening?</p><p>Here's some sample code:</p><pre><code>mStatusView = inflater.inflate(            R.layout.header,            (ViewGroup) getActivity().findViewById(                    R.id.list_header));mListView.addHeaderView(mStatusView, null /*data*/, false /*isSelectable*/);mListView.setSelectionAfterHeaderView();....mHeaderPager = (ScrollableViewPager) mStatusView.findViewById(R.id.header_pager);</code></pre><p>In the above code, the mStatusView is an entire view, with other elements.  The mHeaderPager is a ViewPager within the mStatusView.  </p>";"OutOfMemoryException thrown due to ImageCache Memory Leak on Android";"<java><android><memory-leaks><bitmap><image-loading>";"S"

If anyone could code the more complex example where there's an unknown number of arrays in the AoA (so N choose 2), you'd be my hero.</p><p>TL;DR/edit</p><p>I need an algorithm to take n-choose-2 arrays from an array of arrays; sum the arrays (e.g. [1,2,3] + [1,2,3] = [2,4,6]); put the add the new summed array into an array of arrays.</p>";"addition of combinations of two-dimensional array list";"<java><multidimensional-array><combinations>";"S"

However, I had to construct 4 different types of windows, and 1 overall game window, all with a built in runner. I had a day and a half to do this, and on a students schedule (especially one with no prior experience writing GUI's and a ban on JOptionPane), I did it fast and messy. With that out of the way here is the problem.</p><p>When running the GUI everything works as planned. However, on around 1/4 times running through the game a random image, will be flipped upside down. It's not always the same image, and doesn't occur every time.

In these two csv files the data recorded is not the same except for name and address.

I was asking about the equals method because the only way I saw of tackling this problem is by doing a great deal of string comparisons along the way. My approach is going to be to develop a very specific sort on the csv prior to entering the program that essentially puts the last name (or the address I haven't figured out which one will be better) in alphabetical order then running a binary search like algorithm on the clients or some sort of pointer driven search that would look for the desired client via last name and address. This was all going to be done after I had read the two csv file and essentially parsed the info into a client object. After all of your comments it looks like my question is not really about the string .equals() method but rather about is there a more efficient manner of comparing and compiling the two client objects without having to iterate through both csv files.</p>";"Using a lot of String Comparisons...

According to the documentation, we need to override the check method in the Security class (which is extended from Secure.Security) in order to check the user's profile. I had done the same i.e. added the check annotation @Check('admin') in the Admin controller and override the method in the Security class. But the check method (overridden method) is never called. why this is so?? Am I getting something wrong here??</p><p>Here  is the structure of the Admin class...</p><pre><code>@With(Secure.class)@Check('admin')public class Admin extends JapidContorller {  /**  * An action to render the index page of the Back end admin module.  */  public static void index(){     renderJapid();  }  /**   * An action to render the login page of the Back end admin module.   */   public static void adminLogin() {      renderJapid();  }  /**   * An method to log out the logged in user.   */   public static void adminLogout(){      renderJapid();   }}</code></pre><p>And in Security class</p><pre><code>public class Security extends Secure.Security {    public static boolean authenticate(String username, String password){      -----------------      -----------------    }    public static boolean check(String profile){       System.out.println('[Security]  The check from security is called');       return true;    }}</code></pre><p>But here the check is never called when I request the Admin.index() page.So here I need uyour help on two different issue.1 ) If the application is having more than one login page, then how should we handle the user's authentication using secure module.2) The overridden check method is never called.</p><p>Please help me here.

Display the result of each search to see if they were retrieved correctly. Then remove one of them and show the list to be sure that it was removed correctly.</p><p>I wasn't entirely sure how to test this. What should I write in the main class? Also, is the rest of the code correct? </p><p><strong>Do this for Contact Class:</strong> </p><p>Create this class in the client package. This class should have three fields (An email address, A full name, A nick name). All of these should be Strings.</p><p>Provide two constructors: one full constructor (parameters for all three member variables), and one that has a parameter only for the email address. This second constructor will leave the other two fields null.</p><p>Add a toString method (and use the <code>@Override</code> annotation) that works like this:</p><pre><code>Contact c1 = new Contact('jenny@gmail.com');c2.toString() should return 'jenny@gmail.com'.Contact c2 = new Contact('jenny@gmail.com', 'Jennifer Abott', 'jenny');c2.toString() should return 'Jennifer Abott (jenny) jenny@gmail.com'.</code></pre><p><strong>Do this for AddressBook Class:</strong></p><ol><li>Create this class and have a single member variable of type <code>ArrayList&lt;Contact&gt;</code>.

It returns nothing. Remove that contact from the contact list. Hint: Use the search method that you already wrote in order to find the contact, then remove that contact from the contact list. See the online documentation for ArrayList for how the remove method works in the ArrayList class. Be sure that the remove method does not crash if you give it a nick name that does not exist in the list.</li><li>Write a search method that has a String parameter, which is a nick name to search for. The method must iterate over the contact list. If the nick name is found (use .equals), return that contact. If no contact is found, return null.</li><li><p>Write a show method that displays each Contact instance. It has no parameters and returns nothing. Display one contact per line, and number each line.

The framework reads test data from an excel file and uses Selenium webdriver to control the browser and perform tests. </p><p>I am adding functionality to this framework by adding a TestNG class that reads data from a CSV file.

GWTProject is an examplary GWT project (taken from official GWT tutorial).</p><p>Both projects work fine alone. That is, I can create EMF (EntityManagerFactory) in JPAProject and get entities from the database. GWTProject works fine too, I can run it, fill the field text in the browser and get the response.</p><p>My goal is to call JPAProject from GWTProject to get entities.

When running the GWT project, in <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> there is only <code>gwt-servlet.jar</code>.  </p><p>Do you think that making custom Ant file to build whole thing up is the only solution (i.e. make jar out of the JPA project and copying it to <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>)? Or is there any Eclipse solution, so I could set the GWT project properties properly so GWT project would know to include <code>persistence.xml</code> file?</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> OK, I got it working. I tried to put persitence.xml everywhere in war/WEB-INF where it was possible, but kept getting 'no persistence provider' error. It turned out that it wasn't about persistence.xml. I didn't copy the eclipselink jar to WEB-INF/lib, so it couldn't find provider class defined in persistence.xml.

However, it still works in the console!</p><p>My hypothesis is that when run from the console (as an administrative user, in case it's relevant) the Java Service Wrapper starts a 64-bit JVM and is able to access the regular 64-bit registry. Then, when run as a service (via the LOCALSYSTEM user) it starts a 32-bit JVM (which would then try to access the oh-so-special 32-bit registry in the Wow6432bit node. The entries I'm looking for are absent from this node, which would then explain why I get null values for them in this case.</p><p>This leads to my question: why on Earth would the Java Service Wrapper start a 32-bit JVM when started via the services list, and why would it start a 64-bit JVM when started from the console?</p><p>NOTE: I'm using Java Service Wrapper 3.5.14 and in my config file I have </p><p><code>wrapper.java.additional.auto_bits=TRUE</code></p><p>Ideally, I'd like to keep the JVM selection automatic, so I can use one installer to deploy my software on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

"2016-01-24 00:11:56";"<p>I have been following a tutorial on tracking circular/elliptical objects with OpenCV 3.1.0 on Android and I need some help with code optimization and improving the recognition accuracy. Currently, the code tries to find all circles in each frame and draw an outline around it. Since I am very new to OpenCV, I was hoping someone could help me with the following issues:</p><p>-When the camera recognizes a circular object and draws an outline, the framerate drops to 1-2fps. Otherwise, the framerate is decent. How can I optimize my code to remedy this?</p><p>-I want to track a very specific object which also happens to be an imperfect circle.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, here is my current code:</p><pre><code>import javax.swing.JOptionPane;public class Assignment5{      public static String top1 = ' ';      public static String top2 = ' ';      public static String top3 = ' ';      public static String mid1 = ' ';      public static String mid2 = ' ';      public static String mid3 = ' ';      public static String bot1 = ' ';      public static String bot2 = ' ';      public static String bot3 = ' ';  //Generate the game board  public static void gameBoard()  {    System.out.println('+-----------+');    System.out.println('| ' + top1 + ' | ' + top2 + ' | ' + top3 + ' |');    System.out.println('+-----------+');    System.out.println('| ' + mid1 + ' | ' + mid2 + ' | ' + mid3 + ' |');    System.out.println('+-----------+');    System.out.println('| ' + bot1 + ' | ' + bot2 + ' | ' + bot3 + ' |');    System.out.println('+-----------+');  }  public void main(String args[])  {    gameBoard();  }}</code></pre>";"What is a NullPointerException?";"<java><nullpointerexception>";"S"

The files at the moment are saved inside the webapp context, and I need to save them outside of context.</p><p>If there were only a few classes that upload these files I could spend a few days changing every class and direct it to a path outisde of context, but there are way too many classes, so I have to figure out a way to do it without changing every class, or any class at all, which would be ideal.</p><p>Every upload is done in the following way:</p><p>I get real path of one of my main folders: </p><pre><code>String realpath = httpServletRequest.getSession()                                    .getServletContext()                                    .getRealPath('/mainfolder1/mainsubfolder1/');</code></pre><p>Then I get the file and set custom file name: </p><pre><code>FormFile file = myForm.getFile();String contentType = file.getContentType();String fileName  = file.getFileName();int fileSize     = file.getFileSize();customFileName = 'anyName' + fileName.substring(fileName.lastIndexOf('.'));</code></pre><p>Then I validate and save the file:</p><pre><code>if (fileSize &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contentType != null &amp;&amp; fileName.length() &gt; 0){    InputStream in = file.getInputStream();    OutputStream bos = new FileOutputStream(realpath + '/' + customFileName);    int byteRead = 0;    byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];    while ((byteRead = in.read(buffer, 0, 8192)) != -1){      bos.write(buffer, 0, byteRead);    }    bos.close();    in.close();}</code></pre><p>Very simple way to save my files, and as you can see, they are saved inside context.</p><p>So if I could somehow override java.io.FileOutputStream, to not only save it inside context, but to make a copy outside of context too, that would be great, like save it in the specified path and also on some other path outside of context.</p><p>But I don't know if this is possible, or how to reproduce this behaviour. </p><p><strong>What I need is to keep the class code exactly as it is but write the file 2 times:</strong></p><blockquote>  <p><strong>First here</strong>: '<code>/insideContext/mainfolder1/mainsubfolder1/</code>' </p>    <p><strong>Then here</strong>: '<code>/outsideContext/mainfolder1/mainsubfolder1/</code>'</p></blockquote><p>Is this possible?

Now there is even more pressing problem on the reading side of it. Atleast when writing a message one has the control of the byte buffers used as intermediate storage ( and so one can code to reuse the buffers ) , but on the reading side of Netty ( ie an Upstream event ) , the OioWorker and NioWorker classes completely make it impossible to plugin the <code>byte[]</code> used for reading from network's  <code>InputStream</code>. For example the <code>run()</code> method of <code>OioWorker</code>  is called for reading bytes. This method creates a new byte[] . </p><p>How can I tell Netty to stop doing this and maybe reuse some ChannelBuffer ?

How do i actually get the right back to the caller? The control flow is now:</p><p>The onRequest method is called, but I do now know whether it is the answer to my previous call. What i do is putting all responses reaching my server into a Map, and just poll that list in the Invoker.</p><p>A rough sketch might be;</p><p><strong>Invoker (provides API to client)</strong></p><pre><code>class Invoker {    private Channel channel;    public Invoker(Channel channel) { this.channel = channel; }    public Object call(String server, String name, Object .. args) {        JSONRPCRequest req = ...;        channel.sendMessage(server, req.toString());        while( ! channel.hasResponse(req.id()) {            Thread.sleep(42);        }        return channel.getResponse(req.id()).result();            }}</code></pre><p><strong>Channel (interface to messenger):</strong></p><pre><code>class Channel {    private Map&lt;Object, JSONRPCResponse&gt; responses = new //;    private Sip sip = new Sip() {        public void onRequest(String msg) {            JSONRPCResponse response = JSONRPCResponse.parse(msg);            responses.put(msg.id(), response);        }    };    public void sendMessage(String server, String message) {        sip.sendMessage();    }    public boolean hasResponse onRequest(Object id) {        responses.hasKey(id);    }    public JSONRPCResponse getResponse(Object id) {        responses.get(id);        responses.delete(id);    }}</code></pre><p><strong>SIP (messenger itself):</strong></p><pre><code>abstract class Sip {    public void sendMessage(String msg) {        // SIP magic    }    public abstract void onRequest(String msg);    }</code></pre><p>Is there a better way to do that? My biggest problems/code smells are:</p><ul><li>the blocking in Invoker </li><li>the protocol is in Invoker, maybe I want to switch marshalling to something else</li><li>the map as mean to get the correct response for a request</li><li>the SIP abstract method looks strange</li><li>No error handling</li><li>No timeout</li></ul><p><strong>Message Passing</strong></p><p>Is there an easy way to get rid of RPC, and implement something like RPC with just message passing? Any hints for pattern are welcome. I do not need the code itself, I am totally fine with just architecture. I tried to google for message passing implementations, and how they actually change state with it, but I did not find anything useful. How to implement timeout/ error handling?</p><p>Any good books/literature on that topic is also welcome, as I never programmed such distributed stuff.</p><p>Any other ideas on which protocol to use inside SIP to change state is welcome, too, as RPC was my initial thought, and I did not find anything other useful.</p><p>The code will not compile, I guess, it was just to visualize my idea.</p>";"Implement RPC with underlying request/response protocol (JSON-RPC on SIP)";"<java><callback><sip><rpc>";"S"

Below is how I create the client-side SSL context and SSL handler.</p><pre><code>public static SSLContext createClientSslContext() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, KeyManagementException {    SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance('TLS');    // create a trust-all manager    TrustManager trustAllManager = new X509TrustManager() {        @Override        public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException {        }        @Override        public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException {        }        @Override        public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {            log.debug('do nothing - getAcceptedIssuers');            return new X509Certificate[0];        }    };    context.init(null, new TrustManager[]{trustAllManager}, null);    return context;}private SslHandler createClientSslHandler() {    try {        SSLContext context = SslContextFactory.createClientSslContext();        SSLEngine engine = context.createSSLEngine();        engine.setUseClientMode(true);        engine.setEnabledProtocols(new String[]{'TLSv1.2', 'TLSv1.1', 'TLSv1', 'SSLv3'});        return new SslHandler(engine);    } catch (Exception e) {        log.error('Failed to create SslHandler with exception:', e);        return null;    }}</code></pre><p>I set javax.net.debug=all. Below is error output. </p><pre><code>*** ClientHello, TLSv1.2RandomCookie:  GMT: 1429274460 bytes = { 38, 155, 211, 75, 172, 225, 176, 73, 59, 96, 150, 25, 105, 108, 225, 216, 178, 171, 40, 154, 59, 187, 206, 50, 87, 63, 46, 137 }Session ID:  {}Cipher Suites: [TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5, TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV]Compression Methods:  { 0 }Extension elliptic_curves, curve names: {secp256r1, sect163k1, sect163r2, secp192r1, secp224r1, sect233k1, sect233r1, sect283k1, sect283r1, secp384r1, sect409k1, sect409r1, secp521r1, sect571k1, sect571r1, secp160k1, secp160r1, secp160r2, sect163r1, secp192k1, sect193r1, sect193r2, secp224k1, sect239k1, secp256k1}Extension ec_point_formats, formats: [uncompressed]Extension signature_algorithms, signature_algorithms: SHA512withECDSA, SHA512withRSA, SHA384withECDSA, SHA384withRSA, SHA256withECDSA, SHA256withRSA, SHA224withECDSA, SHA224withRSA, SHA1withECDSA, SHA1withRSA, SHA1withDSA, MD5withRSA***[write] MD5 and SHA1 hashes:  len = 1930000: 01 00 00 BD 03 03 55 31   FF 5C 26 9B D3 4B AC E1  ......U1.&amp;..K..0010: B0 49 3B 60 96 19 69 6C   E1 D8 B2 AB 28 9A 3B BB  .I;`..il....(.;.0020: CE 32 57 3F 2E 89 00 00   38 C0 23 C0 27 00 3C C0  .2W?....8.#.'.&lt;.0030: 25 C0 29 00 67 00 40 C0   09 C0 13 00 2F C0 04 C0  %.).g.@...../...0040: 0E 00 33 00 32 C0 08 C0   12 00 0A C0 03 C0 0D 00  ..3.2...........0050: 16 00 13 C0 07 C0 11 00   05 C0 02 C0 0C 00 04 00  ................0060: FF 01 00 00 5C 00 0A 00   34 00 32 00 17 00 01 00  .......4.2.....0070: 03 00 13 00 15 00 06 00   07 00 09 00 0A 00 18 00  ................0080: 0B 00 0C 00 19 00 0D 00   0E 00 0F 00 10 00 11 00  ................0090: 02 00 12 00 04 00 05 00   14 00 08 00 16 00 0B 00  ................00A0: 02 01 00 00 0D 00 1A 00   18 06 03 06 01 05 03 05  ................00B0: 01 04 03 04 01 03 03 03   01 02 03 02 01 02 02 01  ................00C0: 01                                                 .nioEventLoopGroup-15-0, WRITE: TLSv1.2 Handshake, length = 193[Raw write]: length = 1980000: 16 03 03 00 C1 01 00 00   BD 03 03 55 31 FF 5C 26  ...........U1.&amp;0010: 9B D3 4B AC E1 B0 49 3B   60 96 19 69 6C E1 D8 B2  ..K...I;`..il...0020: AB 28 9A 3B BB CE 32 57   3F 2E 89 00 00 38 C0 23  .(.;..2W?....8.#0030: C0 27 00 3C C0 25 C0 29   00 67 00 40 C0 09 C0 13  .'.&lt;.%.).g.@....0040: 00 2F C0 04 C0 0E 00 33   00 32 C0 08 C0 12 00 0A  ./.....3.2......0050: C0 03 C0 0D 00 16 00 13   C0 07 C0 11 00 05 C0 02  ................0060: C0 0C 00 04 00 FF 01 00   00 5C 00 0A 00 34 00 32  ............4.20070: 00 17 00 01 00 03 00 13   00 15 00 06 00 07 00 09  ................0080: 00 0A 00 18 00 0B 00 0C   00 19 00 0D 00 0E 00 0F  ................0090: 00 10 00 11 00 02 00 12   00 04 00 05 00 14 00 08  ................00A0: 00 16 00 0B 00 02 01 00   00 0D 00 1A 00 18 06 03  ................00B0: 06 01 05 03 05 01 04 03   04 01 03 03 03 01 02 03  ................00C0: 02 01 02 02 01 01                                  ......[Raw read]: length = 50000: 15 03 03 00 02                                     .....[Raw read]: length = 20000: 02 28                                              .(nioEventLoopGroup-15-0, READ: TLSv1.2 Alert, length = 2nioEventLoopGroup-15-0, RECV TLSv1 ALERT:  fatal, handshake_failurenioEventLoopGroup-15-0, fatal: engine already closed.

"2008-12-16 20:42:22";"<p>I'm looking for suggestions on how to inject runtime dependencies into JPA entities retrieved from Hibernate. My problem is essentially this:</p><p>I have a number of different subclasses of a Transaction object. Each Transaction subclass has different behavior when it is executed, and requires a different set of dependencies from the environment. These Transaction objects are managed as JPA entities by Hibernate, so I can't effectively use Guice for dependency injection to populate the instances with their environmental dependencies as I do in the rest of my application.</p><p>To get around this problem, I've taken an approach that's somewhat akin to the Visitor pattern, as follows:</p><pre><code>public abstract class Transaction {    // ...snip...    public abstract void apply(Transactor transactor);}public class TransactionA extends Transaction {    public void apply(Transactor transactor) {        transactor.execute(this);    }}public class TransactionB extends Transaction {    public void apply(Transactor transactor) {        transactor.execute(this);    }}// other Transaction subclasses with the same boilerplatepublic interface Transactor {    public void execute(TransactionA trans);    public void execute(TransactionB trans);    // corresponding methods for other transaction types.}public class BeginTransactor {     @Inject     private Foo execAdep;     public void execute(TransactionA trans) {         execAdep.doSomething(...)         }     @Inject     private Bar execBdep;     public void execute(TransactionB trans) {         execBdep.doOther(...)         } }</code></pre><p>I have various implementations of Transactor for different parts of the transaction lifecycle. These can be dependency-injected using Guice into the context in which I want to process the transactions, where I simply call:</p><pre><code> Transactor transactor = injector.getInstance(BeginTransactor.class); //Guice injection Transaction t = ... //get a transaction instance t.apply(transactor);</code></pre><p>What I don't like about this approach is (1) Not every type of transaction should be executable in each lifecycle phase, but every Transactor must implement an execute() method for every transaction subclass and (2) Essentially none of the injected dependencies are used for processing more than one transaction type.</p><p>Essentially, my Transactor interface &amp; implementations have a lot of unrelated crud glopped together. Ideally I'd just have the execute() method on the transaction object itself, but I don't want the calling code to have to know about the type of the Transaction or the dependencies that it requires. Also, this could make testing harder because I couldn't easily mock out the execute() method if it were a concrete method on the Transaction object. Using the Transactor interface means that I can easily mock it out as needed.</p><p>Can anyone suggest how to address this problem in a typesafe manner that doesn't result in a bunch of mostly-unrelated behavior being glommed together in the Transactor, but keeps the testability and allows for dependency injection?</p>";"Pattern suggestions needed (Hibernate + Guice)";"<java><dependency-injection><design-patterns>";"S"

"2016-06-08 15:30:20";"<p>I apologize that this is so long.  If you are familiar with doing client-auth in Java you can probably skim/skip to the bottom.  I took me a long time to find all the relevant bits of information from disparate sources.  Maybe this will help someone else.</p><p>I'm working on a proof-of-concept to get client-side authentication working from a Java client using the Windows keystore.  I have a servlet that I have created that can request or require client certificates.  It simply returns an HTML response containing the certificate information including subject DN and the serial number.  I've worked through a number of experiments with browsers (mainly Chrome and IE) to verify it is working.  I've gotten successful client authentication working with both certs I've generated with SSL and also using certs issued by my companies internal CA.</p><p>My next step is to have a Java client that works with the MSCAPI keystore in Java.  The reason I went this route is that the certificates we want to use are issued by our internal CA and are automatically added to the Personal keystore in Windows and are marked as non-exportable.  I know there are ways to get the private key out of the keystore with some free tools if you are an admin on your workstation.  This isn't a viable option in this case for various reasons.  Here's the code I ended up with:</p><pre><code>private static SSLSocketFactory getFactory() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, KeyStoreException, CertificateException, IOException, UnrecoverableKeyException, KeyManagementException {  KeyStore roots = KeyStore.getInstance('Windows-ROOT', new SunMSCAPI());  KeyStore personal = KeyStore.getInstance('Windows-MY', new SunMSCAPI());  roots.load(null,null);  personal.load(null,null);  TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());  tmf.init(roots);  KeyManagerFactory kmf = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());  kmf.init(personal, ''.toCharArray());  SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance('TLS');  context.init(kmf.getKeyManagers(), tmf.getTrustManagers(), new SecureRandom());  return context.getSocketFactory();}</code></pre><p>This works but when I connect, the Java client is authenticating with the client-certs I had previously generated.  I don't see an obvious way to force the selection of a specific key so I figured it was just picking the first key it came across that the host trusts.  I then removed these certs that I had created from the windows keystore and it would no longer authenticate.  I triple-checked that the server-side was still works with the browsers and it does.  I then readded these certs to the personal keystore and removed the trust of my pseudo-CA from the server-side.  Still works in the browser and not in the client.</p><p>I added -Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake to my VM parameters and started looking through the output.  One thing I see is are lines 'found key for : [alias]' for each of the certs that I have added but not for the ones added through the 'self-enrollment' feature of certmgr.msc.  Initially I thought it was because they were exportable but I removed them and added one back as non-exportable and java can still use it.  I'm at a loss as to why SunMSCAPI won't use these certs.  Both the ones created by me and internal CA are sha256RSA.  Both are enabled for client authentication.  When I add the following code, I see that isKeyEntry() is false for all the key-pairs I want to use:</p><pre><code>Enumeration&lt;String&gt; aliases = personal.aliases();while (aliases.hasMoreElements()){  String alias = aliases.nextElement();  System.out.println(alias + ' ' + personal.isKeyEntry(alias));}</code></pre><p>I found someone else with a similar issue <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13652206/some-certificates-private-keys-in-windows-my-not-detected'>here</a> but no definitive answer.</p>";"SunMSCAPI not recognizing private keys for some keystore entries";"<java><security><authentication><ssl><mscapi>";"N"

I want to know if it is possible to improve this performance, so that it may take 16 seconds from second run while invoking from Java program.</p><p>Below is a sample code, which will not compile straightaway because of the loggers:</p><pre><code>public static void convert(String sInputDocument) throws IOException {    StringBuffer sbError = new StringBuffer();    List&lt;String&gt; command = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();    command.add('cscript');    String vbs = '//path/to/vbscript';    command.add(vbs);    command.add(sInputDocument);    ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder(command);    //Map&lt;String, String&gt; environ = builder.environment();    builder.directory(new File(System.getenv('temp')));    logger.info('Command : ' + builder.command());    final Process process = builder.start();    InputStream is = process.getInputStream();    InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(is);    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);    String lineOutput;    while ((lineOutput = br.readLine()) != null) {        sbError.append(lineOutput + 'n');    }    br.close();    isr.close();    is.close();    is = process.getErrorStream();    isr = new InputStreamReader(is);    br = new BufferedReader(isr);    String lineError;    while ((lineError = br.readLine()) != null) {        sbError.append(lineError + 'n');    }    br.close();    isr.close();    is.close();    if(sbError.indexOf('FILE OPEN ERROR') != -1) {        throw new IOException('FILE OPEN ERROR: The file does not exist');    }    else if(sbError.indexOf('Command failed') != -1) {        throw new IOException('Unable to convert the document');    }    logger.error(sbError.toString());}</code></pre>";"invoking vbs program from java - performance";"<java><vbscript><pdf-generation>";"N"

"2016-02-20 15:51:13";"<p>I'm currently implementing parsing of JSON to POJO.</p><p>My Model class looks like this:</p><pre><code>public class InvoiceModel {    @JsonDeserialize(using=MeteorDateDeserializer.class)    Date date;    String userId;    String customerName;    ArrayList&lt;PaymentModel&gt; payments;    [...getters, setters...]}</code></pre><p>a JSON string could look like this:</p><pre><code>{  'date': {    '$date': 1453812396858  },  'userId': 'igxL4tNwR58xuuJbE',  'customerName': 'S04',  'payments': [    {      'value': 653.5,      'paymentMethod': 'Cash',      'userId': 'igxL4tNwR58xuuJbE',      'date': {        '$date': 1453812399033      }    }  ]}</code></pre><p>though the <strong>payments</strong> field may be omitted. Anywho, doesn't really matter too much for the question. You see, the format for parsing the date is somewhat 'odd' as in it is encapsulated in the '$date' property of the 'date' object. This is however not in my control.</p><p>To get around this problem I wrote a custom JSON Deserializer to use for this date property. It looks like this:</p><pre><code>public class MeteorDateDeserializer extends org.codehaus.jackson.map.JsonDeserializer&lt;Date&gt; {    @Override    public Date deserialize(JsonParser jsonParser, DeserializationContext deserializationContext) throws IOException, JsonProcessingException {        // parse the '$date' field found by traversing the given tokens of jsonParser         while(!jsonParser.isClosed()){            JsonToken jsonToken = jsonParser.nextToken();            if(JsonToken.FIELD_NAME.equals(jsonToken)){                String fieldName = jsonParser.getCurrentName();                jsonToken = jsonParser.nextToken();                if('$date'.equals(fieldName)){                    long timeStamp = jsonParser.getLongValue();                    return new java.util.Date(timeStamp);                }            }        }        return null;    }}</code></pre><p><strong>The exact problem is the following:</strong></p><p>The returned InvoiceModel POJO has every attribute apart from 'date' set to <strong>null</strong>, whereas the date is parsed fine. I have narrowed down the problem to the custom Date Deserializer by not deserializing the date at all (just deserializing the 2 string values and the payments array, which works fine).</p><p>My thesis is that the annotation conveys to Jackson that the custom deserializer is to be used <strong>for the whole class</strong> instead of being used <strong>just for the date field</strong>.According to the <a href='http://(databind/javadoc/2.3.0/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/annotation/JsonDeserialize.html)' rel='nofollow' title='doc'>doc</a> this should not be the case:</p><blockquote>  <p>Annotation use for configuring deserialization aspects, by attaching to 'setter' methods or fields, or to</p></blockquote><p>The call to the serialization is nothing special. It's just a standard ObjectMapper call.</p><pre><code> InvoiceModel invoice = mapper.readValue(s2, InvoiceModel.class);</code></pre><p>where s2 is the JSON string.</p><p>My version of Jackson is <strong>1.9.7</strong></p>";"Jackson Custom Deserializer breaks default ones";"<java><json><serialization><jackson>";"N"

"2013-11-22 11:21:18";"<p><em>I avoided the word bitmap in the title as bitmap in this context usually (?) refers to the bitmap from the underlying image.</em></p><p>I have an image that is segmented into a number of different regions. For each region I have a map of ones and zeros (a bitmap) where 1 represents inside the region and zero outside the region. Not every part of the image is covered with a region, and the regions may overlap. The images are of the dimension (480x360).</p><p>What I would like to do is to overlay the image with a transparent red when you hoover the region with your mouse. My problem is that my current method is very slow and it takes a second or two before the overlay appears.</p><p>My current approach is using a JLayer over my ImagePanel (extension of JPanel drawing a BufferedImage). Then my instance of the LayerUI draws the overlay when the mouse is moved:</p><pre><code>public class ImageHighlightLayerUI extends LayerUI&lt;JPanel&gt; {    private boolean mouseActive;    private Point mousePoint;    private byte[][][] masks;    public void paint(Graphics g, JComponent c) {        super.paint(g, c);        if (mouseActive) {            byte[][] curMask = null;            // Find which region the mouse intersect            for (int i = 0; i &lt; masks.length; i++) {                if (masks[i][mousePoint.x][mousePoint.y] == 1) {                    curMask = masks[i];                    break;                }            }            // Outside region --&gt; don't draw overlay            if (curMask == null) return;            //Transparent red            g.setColor(new Color((float)1.0,                             (float)0.0, (float)0.0, (float)0.8));            //Draw the mask            for(int x = 0; x &lt; curMask.length; x++)                 for(int y = 0; y &lt; curMask[y].length; y++)                     if (curMask[x][y] == 1)                        g.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);        }    }}</code></pre><p>So, how can I make this more efficient? I open to suggestions using other ways than a JLayer. Can I use my bitmap in some 'magic' way with some swing-method? Can I mix it with the underlying bitmap from the BufferedImage? Is removing transparancy the only thing that'll help me? (Which is something I would like to keep)</p><p>Two other side problems which are not necessarily related to the question, but I have yet to solve: </p><ul><li>The overlay is repainted every time the mouse moves. This seems like a waste of resources.</li><li>When regions are overlapping, how do I choose which one to paint?</li></ul>";"Efficient way to color image regions with transparent overlay from a map of [1,0]";"<java><bitmap><overlay><transparency><jlayer>";"N"

Then, I could use the code above to determine at runtime which firmware is running and load the right factory class.</p><pre><code>MyFactory factory;try {    com.somecompany.icm.io.File.exists('foo');    factory = new SomeCompanyFactory();} catch(NoClassDefFoundError ex) {    factory = new OtherCompanyFactory();}// use the factory to create instances of classes of the right package</code></pre><p>Obviously, the instances have to be wrapped in classes that implement a common interface which is applicable in my case.</p><p>This would result in a bit of class overhead (in terms of number of classes and jar file size) but since these classes won't be loaded there should be no effect (or only a little) on the memory usage (We have very limited RAM on this target).</p>";"How to maintain different SW versions with different package names";"<java><api><package><maintenance>";"N"

The problem is that I am not sure that I am modifying the correct classloader. What I'm doing is the following:</p><pre><code>@Mojo(name = 'aggregate', requiresDependencyResolution = ResolutionScope.TEST)public class AcceptanceTestMojo extends AbstractMojo {  private static final String SYSTEM_CLASSLOADER_FIELD_NAME = 'scl';  @Parameter  private String property;  @Component  public PluginDescriptor pluginDescriptor;  @Component  public MavenProject mavenProject;  @Override  public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException {    ClassLoader newClassLoader = null;    List&lt;String&gt; runtimeClassPathElements;    try {      runtimeClassPathElements = mavenProject.getTestClasspathElements();    } catch (DependencyResolutionRequiredException e) {      throw new MojoFailureException(MojoFailureMessages.UNRESOLVED_DEPENDENCIES_MESSAGE);    }    ClassRealm realm = pluginDescriptor.getClassRealm();    ClassRealm modifiedRealm= new ClassRealm( realm.getWorld(), realm.getId(),  realm.getParentClassLoader());    try {      for (String element : runtimeClassPathElements) {        File elementFile = new File(element);        modifiedRealm.addURL(elementFile.toURI().toURL());      }    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {       throw new MojoFailureException(MojoFailureMessages.UNRESOLVED_CLASSES_MESSAGE);    }    pluginDescriptor.setClassRealm(modifiedRealm);</code></pre><p>So I am getting the ClassRealm and I'am making slight changes to the UCP(removing some jars) and after that I set the newly created ClassRealm to the project descriptor. I am also changing the ContextClassLoader and the SystemClassLoader as the project I am executing my plugin on are using them for some interactions. These two are working fine- they are changed and the plugin is working fine with them. The problem is the plugin classloader. Because for some reason when executing my plugin on one project it is looking in the plugin ClassRealm and searching for the needed jars from there. But the code I put above is not fully correct, because when I come to the part where the execution of the plugin is looking in the plugin ClassRealm it is not the modified one- it gets another reference, which I don't know where it comes from. What I think is that I am not setting the ClassRealm correctly or I am missing something else.</p>";"Working with plugin ClassLoader and project ClassLoader";"<java><maven><maven-plugin>";"N"

"2014-04-13 10:28:30";"<p>I am working on integrating third party javascript libraries into a Vaadin WidgetSet for a Liferay portal. I am using Vaadin version 6.7.3 and Liferay 6.1.</p><p>There are, so far, two independent projects and each generates a differente jar file. The <code>inherits</code> element is the same in both the cliend-side module descriptors:</p><pre><code>&lt;inherits name='com.vaadin.portal.gwt.PortalDefaultWidgetSet' /&gt;</code></pre><p>When I use the Vaadin Liferay Control Panel to recompile my WidgetSet, I see that the results of the compilation are dumped into <code>tomcat-folder/webapps/ROOT/html/VAADIN/widgetsets/com.vaadin.portal.gwt.PortalDefaultWidgetSet</code>, which is expected.</p><p>Each Widget defines their own javascript and stylesheets in their client-side module descriptors like so:</p><h3>Widget 1</h3><pre><code>&lt;script src='script_1.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;stylesheet src='styles_1.css'&gt;&lt;/stylesheet&gt; </code></pre><h3>Widget 2</h3><pre><code>&lt;script src='script_2.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;stylesheet src='styles_2.css'&gt;&lt;/stylesheet&gt;</code></pre><p>Since each javascript file and stylesheet is named differently, I see that the folder <code>tomcat-folder/webapps/ROOT/html/VAADIN/widgetsets/com.vaadin.portal.gwt.PortalDefaultWidgetSet</code> does contain <code>script_1.js</code>, <code>script_2.js</code>, <code>styles_1.css</code> and <code>styles_2.css</code>. </p><p>The problem is that there are name clashes. Both widgets define styles and functions in their stylesheets/javascript files, but some names are the same, which leads to unexpected behaviour. Using firebug, I have confirmed that both stylesheets and both javascript files are loaded when using either one of the widgets. I have also checked that if I undeploy one of the widgets and recompile the widget set, it works perfectly.</p><p>Since those javascripts and stylesheets are actually third party provided and have been obfuscated for my reading pleasure, it would be a bit tedious to go through all names to resolve conflicts.</p><p>I have tried to force the gwt compiler to rename the widgetset by passing properties in the client-side module descriptor, like so:</p><pre><code>&lt;set-property name='widgetset' value='custom.widgetset.FooBarWidgetSet'/&gt;</code></pre><p>And also like so:</p><pre><code>&lt;set-configuration-property name='widgetset' value='custom.widgetset.FooBarWidgetSet'/&gt;</code></pre><p>I was expecting that for each widget, a different folder under <code>tomcat-folder/webapps/ROOT/html/VAADIN/widgetsets</code> for each widget would be created, but it didn't work. To be honest, I am not sure if this is even possible, since the Vaadin Liferay Control Panel has a field stating <em>Active WidgetSet</em> (see <a href='http://vaadin.com/download/book-of-vaadin/vaadin-6/html/img/portal/liferay-control-panel-1.png' rel='nofollow'>this related image</a>)</p><p>My question is: how is it possible to resolve name conflicts across different stylesheets/javascript files? </p>";"Name conflicts in Vaadin WidgetSet";"<java><javascript><gwt><liferay><vaadin>";"N"

For better understanding i will first describe the architecture a little bit:<br>We have a basic web-api as a maven project which provides basic webservices based on Generic-Types. Then i have an API maven project where an abstract websevice class extends the webservice described above and provides the generic types (timeseries in my case) and adds a few additional webservices. And third i have my example implementation where a webservice class with a @Path- Annotation on class level extends the abstract class from the API and hence gets the Paths from the superclasses (create, get and other standard operations from the first framework and context relevant operations from the second API).<br>For documentation of this API i want to use swagger. I added the needed dependencies for swagger-jaxrs and swagger-annotations (both in version 1.5.3-M1) and put the BeanConfig in my Application. I also get the generated API if, and only if, i annotate my implementating classes method with @Path - Annotations. The problem with this is that i can not access my API because Wildfly can´t resolve the method to use (because i declared the @Path at two different levels i guess).<br>So my question is: is such a setup possible with swagger or do i have to have @Path-Annotations at the level of the @ApiX-Annotations of swagger?<br>Side-Note: The setup is wanted to have an API that has the given paths as a MUST so you can change the implementations but don´t have to change the clients (e.g. for different databases or business models)<br>Thanks for any answers :)<br>EDIT: ok so i found my initial error: if i specify the path at the method in the subclass i need to specify all other jax-rs annotations as well. But my question stays the same: can i get swagger to use the jax-rs annotations of the superclasses in any way?</p>";"Use @Path-Annotation from abstract Superclass in Swagger";"<java><resteasy><wildfly><swagger>";"N"

"2011-03-04 23:17:11";"<p>I need some guidance on a java project. I'm to develop a human genetic(family) tree.</p><p>This is the subject:</p><p>Each human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes numbered from 1 to 22,and a pair of sex chromosomes: XX in females and XY in man. During fertilization, the 22 chromosomes + (X or Y) of the man merges with the 22 + X chromosome of the woman. This results in 22 pairs of chromosomes + (X or Y) in the cell that will form the future baby. The 23rd chromosome transmitted by the father (an X or Y) will determine the sex of the child (XX for a girl, XY for a boy).</p><p>Each chromosome carries many genes (encoding almost everything, a characteristic morphological, physiological, behavioral). Due to pairs of chromosomes, the genetic information is duplicated (except for parts of the sex chromosomes). Each copy of a gene is called an allele. So that means for example, if the a gene is responsible for the color of an eye, then the allele is blue.</p><p>The genetic information expressed as a consequence of the combined expression of alleles being present. A dominant allele is always expressed in the genome of its bearer. However, if information from one allele is not expressed when a dominant allele of the same gene is present, it is a recessive allele. The peculiarity of the recessive allele of a gene is that it can be present in the genome and transmitted over several generations without it is expressed in the phenotype its bearers. If there is no dominant allele, two copies of the gene have the same recessive allele (homozygous recessive) then the recessive character is expressed. Through the use of family tree, it is possible to determine the expression of a gene within a family.</p><p>The program should be able to do the following:</p><ul><li>generate a simplified version relied on 23 chromosomes and allow the user to place genes on chromosomes then simulate replication, mitosis, meiosis and fusion of the chromosomes and display the locations of genes on the resulting cells.</li><li>allow to draw genealogical trees and deduced probabilities (or certainty) on the expression of genes on a person's family tree.</li></ul><p>So far so good i've created a class Gene and a class Chromosome. Next, i thought about creating a class 'Parent' for example and creating 23 chromosomes in it. But before doing that i want to make the 23rd chromosome different for a man/woman. Then simulates replication, crossovers, mitosis etc.. I don't know if i'm on the right track. I also don't know how to specify that a particular allele/gene is recessive or dominant. For the moment my classes only act in a random manner.</p><p>Gene.java</p><pre><code>import java.util.Random;/** * @author mkab * */public class Gene implements Cloneable {    private Object allele;    public Gene(){        super();    }    public Gene(Object allele){        super();        this.allele = allele;    }    /**     * Randomly selects a trait from trait1 or trait2 and returns a new Gene with that trait     * @param trait1     * @param trait2     *      * @return a new Gene     */    public Gene randomAllele(Object trait1, Object trait2){        Object allele = null;        Random rand = new Random();        int i = rand.nextInt(2);// generate between 0 and 2: only 2 possibilities: 0 or 1        switch(i){        case 0:            allele = trait1;            break;        case 1:            allele = trait2;            break;        }        return new Gene(allele);    }    public Gene clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException{        Gene g;        g = (Gene) super.clone();        return g;    }    /**     * @param allele the allele to set     */    public void setAllele(Object allele) {        this.allele = allele;    }    /**     * @return the allele     */    public Object getAllele() {        return allele;    }    /* (non-Javadoc)     * @see java.lang.Object#toString()     */    @Override    public String toString() {        return 'Gene [allele=' + allele +']';    }}</code></pre><p>Chromosome.java</p><pre><code>import java.util.ArrayList;import java.util.Iterator;/** * Class that creates a pair of chromosome by adding random genes * @author mkab * */public class Chromosome implements Cloneable {    /**     * the user can put as many genes as possible on the chromosome     */    private ArrayList&lt;Gene&gt; genes = new ArrayList&lt;Gene&gt;();    public Chromosome(){        super();    }    public Chromosome(ArrayList&lt;Gene&gt; genes){        this.genes = genes;    }    /**     * Add a gene object to this chromosomes list.     */    public void addGene(Gene gene) {        genes.add(gene);    }    /**     *creates a copy of a chromosome     */    @SuppressWarnings('unchecked')    @Override    public Chromosome clone()throws CloneNotSupportedException{        Chromosome c;        c = (Chromosome) super.clone();        c.genes = (ArrayList&lt;Gene&gt;)this.genes.clone();        //Iterator&lt;Gene&gt; it = c.genes.iterator();        /*Gene tmp;          while(it.hasNext()){          }*/        return c;    }    /**     * @return the genes     */    public ArrayList&lt;Gene&gt; getGenes() {        return genes;    }    /**     * @param genes the genes to set     */    public void setGenes(ArrayList&lt;Gene&gt; genes) {        this.genes = genes;    }    /**     *      * @return     */    public int getSize(){        return genes.size();    }    /**     * @return a gene at an index i of the ArrayList     * @param index - the index at which to return a gene     */    public Gene getGenes(int index) {        return genes.get(index);    }    /* (non-Javadoc)     * @see java.lang.Object#toString()     */    @Override    public String toString() {        return 'Chromosome [genes=' + genes + ']';    }}</code></pre><p>Thanks</p>";"Genetic processes help in java";"<java><bioinformatics>";"N"

For example, both only pass their values to child threads on thread creation (if a child thread updates an <code>MDC</code> value then it doesn't propagate to the parent and vice-versa - same as <code>InheritableThreadLocal</code>) and both need to be removed manually by the developer by calling the <code>remove</code> method especially when using thread pools.

I was hoping to allow a script to add itself using the syntax <code>objectToListenTo.addListener(method)</code>, where <code>method</code> is a JavaScript function. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, when passing a function back to a Java method, the method receives an object of type <code>ScriptObjectMirror</code>, which I am unsure of how to notify of a certain event. I know that Nashorn has a method called <code>getInterface</code> which allows me to implement an interface using a JavaScript method, but this can only really be done from plain Java.

Therefore, there are two methods, one to change picture using countdowntimer and another to change picture using onClick method corresponding to imagebutton. </p><p>The problem I'm running into is the code provided in the link (method called from within an onclick method) is supposed to change the image, set a bool value to false, wait 1.5 seconds, and then change the same bool value back to true. </p><p>While the bool value is true, the method that changes the pictures is supposed to be skipped but that's not the case and I don't know why but i think it's something to do with the code in the gists I created below. </p><p>So the issue I have is when the button is clicked, the image changes as expected but it sometimes changes again too quickly due to the first method not recognizing that the player responded and thus shouldn't change image yet.  </p><p>Please let me know if any further details or anything is needed and thank you again for time and help!!</p><p><a href='https://gist.github.com/cjayem13/d32446ceb8c6d9626c68#file-easyfragment-java' rel='nofollow'>https://gist.github.com/cjayem13/d32446ceb8c6d9626c68#file-easyfragment-java</a><a href='https://gist.github.com/cjayem13/d32446ceb8c6d9626c68' rel='nofollow'>https://gist.github.com/cjayem13/d32446ceb8c6d9626c68</a></p><p><a href='https://gist.github.com/cjayem13/d0a0b124dfe17666be25#file-easyfragment-java' rel='nofollow'>https://gist.github.com/cjayem13/d0a0b124dfe17666be25#file-easyfragment-java</a><a href='https://gist.github.com/cjayem13/d0a0b124dfe17666be25' rel='nofollow'>https://gist.github.com/cjayem13/d0a0b124dfe17666be25</a></p><pre><code> onclick(){delayedRandomCue(final long a)}</code></pre>";"Code not executed in expected order?";"<java><android><thread-sleep>";"N"

I can't seem to figure out why it is not working. It can be found in the addUserNum method. For clarification the reason I have the main class as A03Q3 is because of teacher requirements. I also noticed that I receive an out of index error any time I enter a number other than one or if I enter 1 less than 10 times.

I know that when connection is closed in code it is just returned to the pool but still exists in the session. I know that that one of the possible solution is to catch this error and call procedure again in catch block, somehow like this:</p><pre><code>    callProcedure(Params params){         SimpleJdbcCall jdbcCall = getSimpleJdbcCall();            Map&lt;String, Object&gt; results = Collections.EMPTY_MAP;            try {                results = jdbcCall.execute(params);            }catch (UncategorizedSQLException ex){                if (checkOra04067Exception(ex)){                    callProcedure(params);                }            }            return results;        }        private boolean checkOra04067Exception(UncategorizedSQLException ex){            return '72000'.equals(ex.getSQLException().getSQLState()) &amp;&amp;                                  ex.getSQLException().getErrorCode() == 4068;        }</code></pre><p>But is there more elegant way to overcome this problem, not really wanting to place this try-catch block in many DAO objects where the jdbcCall.execute(params) is used. Yes I can do a wrapper for SimpleJdbcCall with try-catch and inject this wrapper where it is needed but maybe there is a possibility to fine tune datasourse to really close connections or remove them completely once it is returned to connection pool? Or is there a the solution to create any query which can validate an oracle package state and use it in 'spring.datasource.validation-query' instead of  'select 1 from dual'.Thanks for your help in advance.P.S I'm using org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSource and oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver</p><p>By The way, code has an issue, so the method returns empty result.It is somehow connected to try-catch block.The first time when there is an error, the callProcedure(params) method triggers once again in catch block and returns result, but then I don't know why but result returns from the call which had been before catch block.

The abstract class CharacterClass has most info that Character has, but not all of it (it doesn't have experience points for instance). The problem is that I have a code duplication ( I create a character by creating a character class (like Fighter, and then assign the data to Character's construction, with some additions), both have strength, hit points, and getHitPoints, and setHitPoints for instance.

"2016-09-25 05:39:43";"<p>I am befuddled by Tasker's Java function interface vs actual Java code, as well as the code itself. I'm relearning Java and newly leaning Tasker, so I need some help.</p><p>The use case I'm trying to implement is relatively simple:</p><p>ENTRY -> Button 'Mute' is pressed -> test if music is playing -> if yes, pause music / if no, go to next step -> set media volume to 0 -> END</p><p>Clearly I need a variable to govern the if/else statement in Step 3.</p><p>This brings me to my Java problem. I'm using some code scraped from one website or another and specialized it in Tasker like this:</p><pre><code>- Tasker Java Function - instantiate a new AudioManager object called manager. The tasker interface structure is this -&gt;&gt; - Return**: manager&gt;&gt; - Class or Object**: Context&gt;&gt; - Function**: getSystemService {AudioManager} (String)&gt;&gt; - Param {string}**: audio- Call method isMusicActive(), which returns the Tasker-formatted variable, %playing. The Tasker interface structure is this -&gt;&gt; - Return {string}**: %playing&gt;&gt; - Class or Object**: manager&gt;&gt; - Function**: isMusicActive {boolean} ()&gt;&gt; - Param**: null {isMusicActive}</code></pre><p>Using this, Tasker successfully returns a boolean value to the variable %playing; however, the interface makes very little sense to me because it changes everytime I enter a new value. For example, after I close the task, test it, and go to fix the inevitable error, new fields have appeared in the Java function interface. It's as confusing as hell. Is there a good way to overcome this behavior?</p><p>Based on Tasker's oddities, I thought it might help if I could see the code the interface is writing. No luck, so now I'm writing based on memories from 10 years ago:</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt; - Object manage CONTEXT.getSystemService(AudioManager());&gt;&gt; - Boolean %playing manage.isMusicActive ();</code></pre><p>Does the above work, even if a bit inefficiently? I'm not concerned with tuning the code. I will be the 1 user of it. It doesn't need to scale.</p><p>Back to Tasker... It looks like, after much flailing around, I got the function to work. However, I cannot get Tasker to react to any boolean logic (if %playing matches/equals true, pause music app). </p><p>I tested %playing using a Tasker Flash action, which shows that %playing is correctly set by the Java functions (true if music is playing/false if it is not). Why the Tasker task won't react correctly has been maddening. </p><p>I've done some digging and found Tasker only supports variables in a string format, thus if %playing is returned as a primative Java boolean type, the value contained in %playing needs to be converted to a string before being returned to Tasker, I think. (In Tasker, I'm not even sure how to test a boolean variable but the Flash action seems able to read the variable -  Maybe %playing is actually being returned as a string??)</p><p>If I had to modify the code to convert from a booleen value to a string, , would the following work?</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt; - Boolean playing manager.isMusicActive ();&gt;&gt; - %playing = playing.toString ();</code></pre><p>I'm sorry this post is so lengthy, but I didn't know how to break the problem into two or more posts, and I really want to beat this problem.

"2016-05-11 08:21:21";"<p>I'm building a modular application with Spring and Spring Security. I had the security module working perfectly in the main architecture project but I've now decided to decouple them. In order to do so I tried 2 different approaches. Neither of them worked and I found there's very few documentation on these. I'd like to understand why with at last one of them.</p><p><strong>Approach 1: web-fragments</strong></p><p>In the first approach, I made another jar with a web-fragment. The web-fragment has only to register the Spring Security filter:</p><pre><code>&lt;!-- Spring security filter --&gt;&lt;filter&gt;    &lt;filter-name&gt;springSecurityFilterChain&lt;/filter-name&gt;    &lt;filter-class&gt;org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy&lt;/filter-class&gt;&lt;/filter&gt;&lt;filter-mapping&gt;    &lt;filter-name&gt;springSecurityFilterChain&lt;/filter-name&gt;    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;&lt;/filter-mapping&gt;</code></pre><p>Here Spring throws me an exception that says there's no bean named springSecurityFilterChain. I've read online that this may be caused by the security configuration being loaded later. So I've added the following lines to the web-fragment.xml:</p><pre><code> &lt;!-- Loads the security fragment first --&gt;&lt;ordering&gt;    &lt;before&gt;        &lt;others /&gt;    &lt;/before&gt;&lt;/ordering&gt;&lt;listener&gt;&lt;listener-class&gt;    org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener&lt;/listener-class&gt;&lt;/listener&gt;&lt;context-param&gt;    &lt;param-name&gt;contextConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt;    &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/security-context.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;&lt;/context-param&gt;</code></pre><p>I've also tried to explicitly define the bean in my security-context.xml and creating a java config class which only imports the security xml like this:</p><pre><code> @Configuration @EnableWebSecurity @ImportResource('classpath:WEB-INF/security-context.xml') public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter{}</code></pre><p>With this approach I got rid of the exception because the java config loaded the bean named springSecurityFilterChain. But it's not able to filter the servlet requests. At this point, I switched to the second approach.</p><p><strong>Approach 2: Java config</strong></p><p>I've decided to take advantage of the Spring component scanning that was already enabled on the main architecture. So, as the base package is the same, it should be able to get a bean annotated with <code>@Configuration</code> because it's implicitly annotated with <code>@Component</code> as the official Javadoc states. So I've converted my xml config file into a java one. For the sake of documentation I'll post them both. Again, I've found very little documentation on java config so I mostly did it myself and I'm aware that this may completely wrong:</p><p><em>security-context.xml</em></p><pre><code>&lt;!-- Entrypoints --&gt;&lt;sec:http pattern='/rest/login' security='none' /&gt;&lt;sec:http pattern='/rest/**' entry-point-ref='restAuthenticationEntryPoint'    create-session='stateless'&gt;    &lt;sec:csrf disabled='true' /&gt;    &lt;sec:custom-filter before='FORM_LOGIN_FILTER' ref='jwtAuthenticationFilter' /&gt;&lt;/sec:http&gt;&lt;!-- Enables @PreFilter, @PreAuthorize, @PostFilter, @PostAuthorize on any     Spring bean in context --&gt;&lt;sec:global-method-security pre-post-annotations='enabled' /&gt;&lt;!-- Beans --&gt;&lt;beans:bean id='restAuthenticationEntryPoint'    class='co.aurasphere.aura.security.RestAuthenticationEntryPoint' /&gt;&lt;beans:bean id='restSuccessHandler'    class='co.aurasphere.aura.security.RestAuthenticationSuccessHandler' /&gt;&lt;beans:bean id='restFailureHandler'    class='org.springframework.security.web.authentication.SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler' /&gt;&lt;beans:bean id='jwtAuthenticationProvider'    class='co.aurasphere.aura.security.JwtAuthenticationProvider'&gt;    &lt;beans:property name='jwtUtil' ref='jwtUtil' /&gt;&lt;/beans:bean&gt;&lt;beans:bean id='jwtUtil' class='co.aurasphere.aura.security.JwtUtil' /&gt;&lt;beans:bean id='jwtAuthenticationFilter'    class='co.aurasphere.aura.security.JwtAuthenticationFilter'&gt;    &lt;beans:property name='authenticationManager' ref='jwtAuthenticationManager' /&gt;    &lt;beans:property name='authenticationSuccessHandler'        ref='restSuccessHandler' /&gt;&lt;/beans:bean&gt;&lt;!-- Authentication managers --&gt;&lt;sec:authentication-manager alias='jwtAuthenticationManager'&gt;    &lt;sec:authentication-provider ref='jwtAuthenticationProvider' /&gt;&lt;/sec:authentication-manager&gt;</code></pre><p><em>SecurityConfig.java</em></p><pre><code>@Configuration@EnableWebSecurity@ImportResource('classpath:WEB-INF/security-context.xml')public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter{@Autowiredprivate RestAuthenticationEntryPoint restAuthenticationEntryPoint;@Autowiredprivate RestAuthenticationSuccessHandler restAuthenticationSuccessHandler;@Autowiredprivate JwtAuthenticationFilter jwtAuthenticationFilter;@Autowiredprivate JwtAuthenticationProvider jwtAuthenticationProvider; @Override    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {        auth.authenticationProvider(jwtAuthenticationProvider); }    @Override    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {         http        .csrf().disable()        .exceptionHandling()        .authenticationEntryPoint(restAuthenticationEntryPoint)        .and()          .authorizeRequests()        .antMatchers('/rest/**').authenticated()        .and()        .addFilter(jwtAuthenticationFilter);        http.antMatcher('/rest/login').securityContext().disable();            }    @Bean    public RestAuthenticationSuccessHandler mySuccessHandler(){        return new RestAuthenticationSuccessHandler();    }    @Bean    public SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler myFailureHandler(){        return new SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler();    }    @Override    protected AuthenticationManager authenticationManager() throws Exception {        return super.authenticationManager();    }</code></pre><p>This throws me an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> because the <code>authenticationManager</code> is null, even if I override the <code>authenticationManager()</code> method as I've read on SO.

So I've decided to post this question. I don't mind switching back with the all-in-one module solution if I don't find another solution or get these to work, but I'd really like how this should be done properly, so I can improve my skills.</p><p>Any help is appreciated.

Thus far, we have configured this setup in JBoss by having an entry for each of those databases as a separate data-source in standalone.xml, and for each of them, a separate persistence-unit in persistence.xml.</p><p>We then have a class we call EntityManagerResourceInterface, in which we define an EntityManager for each of the different persistence units, and it has a method to return the appropriate one to other EJBs based on the client of the current request, as roughly shown here:</p><pre><code>...@PersistenceContext(unitName = 'client_2')private EntityManager client2EntityManager;...public EntityManager getEntityManager() {   ...   else if(clientId == 2) {      return (client2EntityManager);   }   ...}...@Produces@EntityManagerQualifier('client_2')public EntityManager getClient2EntityManager() {   return (client2EntityManager);}...</code></pre><p>This has worked fine while we've had less than 15 clients, and we could hard-code all of their databases into standalone.xml, persistence.xml, and our EntityManagerResource class, and have every JBoss server connect to all of those databases, etc.  However, we are now scaling to the point where this is no longer working for us (both from the perspective of maintaining these files, and from having this many resources consumed in each JBoss server).</p><p>So, what we would like to do would be to only have 1 entry in standalone.xml and persistence.xml for all of these per-client databases, and since we are already always accessing EntityManager instances through our EntityManagerResource class, we want to somehow make it point the EntityManager instance at the correct database before it returns the EntityManager to a caller.  This way, whether a particular JBoss server is serving a single client, or many clients, and whatever client ids are being serviced, they can all work with the same JBoss configuration.  And, that way, each JBoss server will only be connected to, and consuming resources for, the clients that it is serving. </p><p>We have attempted to use Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(), passing a property map including 'hibernate.default_schema' set to point at the appropriate client-specific database, and this has worked for read-only operations, but we're apparently not correctly re-using the EntityManagers (i.e., every time we try to modify or delete an entity, we're told it's not managed).  I can post some of that code if needed, but I kinda feel like we went the wrong way with it...  Especially as we've learned now that our application uses JTA and/or CMT, so using an EntityManagerFactory seems like NOT the thing for us to be doing.</p><p>Please let us know if there is a 'standard' way to configure a setup like this in JBoss with Hibernate, or a library out there to help.</p>";"How to configure JBoss, Hibernate data-sources, persistence-units, and EntityManager for per-client database architecture";"<java><hibernate><jpa><jboss>";"N"

"2016-09-14 18:55:31";"<p>I'm designing an editable TableView and wanted to use keys to move between cells.  It works mostly, but only going specific directions at specific cells.  At some I can move up and right, but not down or left; or I can move left and right but not up and down.  And the behavior changes every time I test it. </p><p>I have this in a custom TableCell class (the cell is heavily modified, so this code alone isn't enough to make the cell behave exactly like mine, but I think this should show where the problem is):</p><pre><code>textField.setOnKeyPressed(event-&gt;{        TablePosition&lt;T,?&gt; from = getTableView().getEditingCell();        switch(event.getCode()){        case ESCAPE:            escPressed = true;            cancelEdit();            break;        case SHIFT:            shiftPressed = true;            return;        case UP:            System.out.print('Up   : ');            moveTo(from.getRow()-1, from.getColumn());            break;        case DOWN:        case ENTER:            System.out.print('Down : ');            moveTo(from.getRow()+1, from.getColumn());            break;        case TAB:            if(shiftPressed){                System.out.print('Left : ');                moveTo(from.getRow(), from.getColumn()-1);            }            else {                System.out.print('Right: ');                moveTo(from.getRow(), from.getColumn()+1);            }            break;        default:            return;        }        shiftPressed = false;        TablePosition&lt;T,?&gt; to = getTableView().getEditingCell();        if(to == null){            System.err.printf('Stopped at (%d, %d)n',                    from.getRow(), from.getColumn());        }        else {            System.out.printf('Moved from (%d, %d) to (%d, %d)n',                     from.getRow(), from.getColumn(),                     to.getRow(), to.getColumn());        }        event.consume();    });</code></pre><p>And the method <code>moveTo</code> is defined as such:</p><pre><code>//Returns false if it was out of bounds (for wrapping)private boolean moveTo(int row, int col){    if(row &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; col &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; row &lt; getTableView().getItems().size()             &amp;&amp; col &lt; getTableView().getColumns().size())    {        getTableView().edit(row, getTableView().getColumns().get(col));        return true;    }    return false;}</code></pre><p>The class has to do some funky things to properly commit changes when exiting focus, but this should be the problem area.  To test this, I autogenerated a table and moved around in the cells.  Here's an example of the output:</p><pre><code>Down : Moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)  //  Can move down fine....Right: Moved from (3, 2) to (3, 3)  //  And to the rightLeft : Stopped at (3, 3)            //  But the left doesn't work...Down : Moved from (8, 2) to (9, 2)Down : Stopped at (9, 2)            //  At an arbitrary row,                                     //down stops working.Up   : Stopped at (9, 2)            //  So does going back up.Up   : Moved from (10, 2) to (9, 2) //  But going from 10 up ...                                 //to 9 works fine....Up   : Moved from (10, 1) to (9, 1) //  This behavior affects theUp   : Stopped at (9, 1)            //whole row.Up   : Moved from (10, 1) to (9, 1)Right: Moved from (9, 1) to (9, 2)Down : Stopped at (9, 2)Up   : Moved from (10, 2) to (9, 2)...</code></pre><p>The rows/columns that I can't move beyond change every time I run the program, but they're generally around 9-10.  I think the pattern is that I can move from cell <em>A</em> to cell <em>B</em> if and only if I <strong>cannot</strong> move from cell <em>B</em> to cell <em>A</em>.  If I can move down from row 8 to row 9, I cannot move up from 9 to 8.  If I can't move down, I can move up.  This applies for left and right, as well (though the direction flipping is much rarer in the columns).  All I'm doing is selecting indices to increment/decrement, so I cannot for the life of me grasp how this is possible.</p>";"JavaFX - Unexpected behavior when Navigating TableCells using TableView.edit";"<java><javafx>";"N"

Now I would do a simple <code>SELECT * FROM People WHERE last_name ='Smith' ORDER BY first_name DESC OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 3 ROWS ONLY</code>. The people in the result set are then Alan, Barbara, and George Smith. Now if I wanted to get all ages, first_name's, emails, and phone numbers of my result set, it looks like I need to query again but without the offset/fetch clauses, and iterate over the new result set and add each column to a Set. One problem is that will be duplicates in some columns such as first_name, address. So there will be extra iterations when adding these to a Set, unless I do individual <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> on each column.</p><p>Now my question is, is there a more efficient way to obtaining these filters?

Or returning the id, along with the filters available, and use the ids for the paginated query?

Passing an additional parameter fixes this:</p><pre><code>&lt;select id='someFunction'                parameterType='com.myCompany.Member'                resultMap='memberMap'                statementType='CALLABLE' &gt;                {call dbo.trp_MembersGet_ById_sp  (#{memberId,jdbcType=INTEGER,mode=IN}, {secondParam,jdbcType=INTEGER,mode=IN})}&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre><p>...but I'd rather have it be a default param so I don't have to have my model have this additional field.</p><p>So, ideally, I think I'd like something like this (below does not work):</p><pre><code>&lt;select     id='someFunction'            parameterType='com.myCompany.Member'            resultMap='memberMap'            statementType='CALLABLE' &gt;            {call dbo.trp_MembersGet_ById_sp  (#{memberId,jdbcType=INTEGER,mode=IN}, {1,jdbcType=INTEGER,mode=IN})}&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre><p>Where '1' is the default value.

But if a change within the directory occurs (such as renaming a file), SolrJ just doesn't seem to let go of the changed file's handle, thus it can no longer be modified.</p><p>What am I doing wrong here?

"2014-05-16 23:04:33";"<p>We are developing a game using PlayN framework and we'll have a global leaderboard stored in Google Cloud Datastore. We acquired the private key needed for accessing the database, it's in a .p12 file, so I assume it's in PKCS#12 format. Right now we added this file to our game project's assets. (The structure of our projects is the standard hierarchy generated by the Maven archetype). It seems that we have two choices:</p><p>1: Somehow create a <code>PrivateKey</code> object and supply that:</p><pre><code>// Code copied from DataStoreHelper Source// Note; One of the setaccountprivatekeymethods must be used.public Credential getDatastoreCredentials(String accountId) throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException{    NetHttpTransport transport = GoogleNetHttpTransport.newTrustedTransport();    JacksonFactory jsonFactory = new JacksonFactory();    return new GoogleCredential.Builder()        .setTransport(transport)        .setJsonFactory(jsonFactory)        .setServiceAccountId(accountId)        .setServiceAccountScopes(DatastoreOptions.SCOPES)        .setServiceAccountPrivateKey(new PrivateKey ???)  // &lt;- You cannot just construct PrivateKey        .build();}</code></pre><p>But that seems to be cumbersome: <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18644286/creating-privatekey-object-from-pkcs12'>Creating PrivateKey Object from PKCS12</a>We haven't found a solution yet.</p><p>2: The better way would be to somehow get hold of the full path of the PKCS#12 file in the assets in a platform independent way:</p><pre><code>// Code copied from DataStoreHelper Source// Note; One of the setaccountprivatekeymethods must be used.public Credential getDatastoreCredentials(String accountId) throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException{    NetHttpTransport transport = GoogleNetHttpTransport.newTrustedTransport();    JacksonFactory jsonFactory = new JacksonFactory();    return new GoogleCredential.Builder()        .setTransport(transport)        .setJsonFactory(jsonFactory)        .setServiceAccountId(accountId)        .setServiceAccountScopes(DatastoreOptions.SCOPES)        .setServiceAccountPrivateKeyFromP12File(new File(???))  // &lt;- acquire file path        .build();}</code></pre><p>We get exception in this case, the variations to get the file path did not work. Normally you access files in the assets by importing <code>playn.core.PlayN.assets</code>, and then calling <code>assets()</code>. For example loading an image is simply <code>Image bgImage = assets().getImage('images/bg.png');</code> while loading a JSON data is a little longer:</p><pre><code>assets().getText(jsonPath, new Callback&lt;String&gt;() {  @Override  public void onSuccess(String json) {    try {      parseJson(images, sprite, json);      ....</code></pre><p>But in our case we'd need the full path (?) of the file.

This is flawed because if the height of a component is reduced enought, or it's really high and then removed, more than one components from the next page can be moved. Also, if you reduce the height of the first component, with it's new height, it may fit in the free space of the previous page.

This also means that upon removal of the element, Component would automatically check if it can fit an additinal component to that blank space and then pull it from the next one.</p><p>Anyway, although what I have written above may not be possible, I hope you get the idea of what I'm trying to achieve here.</p><p>If you have any ideas that would make writing that part of code easier, please tell me what could I do.</p>";"Paginating (and maintaining) a swing jPanel structure";"<java><swing><pagination><jpanel>";"N"
